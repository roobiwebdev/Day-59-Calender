#Day59 of #100DaysChallenge

Hey Everyone

Today’s project was all about creating a simple and functional calendar using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It was an interesting and enjoyable experience to build something so useful yet straightforward.

Here’s a summary of what I did: 

✅ Set Up the HTML & CSS: Created the basic structure and styled it for a clean look. 

✅ JavaScript Logic: Wrote the script to render the calendar, handle month navigation, and reset to the current date. 

✅ Month and Day Handling: Ensured correct handling of months and days, including previous and next month days.

It was a fun and educational exercise, and I'm looking forward to implementing more features in the upcoming days maybe, if u have any idea lemme know.

let's keep pushing forward ⚡️
